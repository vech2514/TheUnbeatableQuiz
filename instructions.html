		<p>Playing this game is fairly simple:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You read the question.</li>
			<li>You think real hard.</li>
			<li>You select your response.</li>
			<li>You click submit.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If your submission is correct it will advance you to 
			the next question. If your submission was incorrect then 
			you will lose one of you three alloted attempts. If you 
			lose all attempts you lose the game. Last rule is you aren't 
			allowed to gloat if you win.</p>

			<li>B, because his name is the same now as it was then.</li>
			<li>A, "Tuesdays" and "two days" are a play on words.</li>
			<li>C + D, because the white house is located in Washington, D.C.</li>
			<li>C, because the letter 'E' is the middle of the phrase.</li>
			<li>C, because there's a mile in it.</li>
